### Lesson 1 The value of your idea
This module focuses on the case of a French startup D-vine, a revolutionary wine maker, to know more please [D-Vine](https://www.10-vins.com/en/the-d-vine)
- How to evaluate your idea
	- three dimensions of value
	- Concepts to master
> Value creation = the difference of willingness-to-pay of the consumer and the willingness-to-sell of the supplier.
- say you want to buy a basket of eggs, you are willing to pay 5$ and seller is willing to sell it for 3$ then the value created is 5-3=2$
> value captured 
- difference between willingness-to-buy and the price is value captured by the consumer 
- difference between willingness-to-sell and the cost is value captured by the supplier 
- difference between cost and the price is value captured by the producer 
> Value added
- the enhancement of value creation

The value-based theory of business strategy
